# 🔍 Investigation Questions
## Operation: Cipherlock — Forensics Analysis

Answer each question in a new file: `forensics/my_answers.md`  
Use evidence from `server_log.txt`, `email_header.txt`, and `file_metadata.txt` to support every answer.

### Section A — Server Log Analysis

**Q1.** What is the username of the primary suspect? What evidence from the server log supports this?

**Q2.** At what time did the suspect's activity become suspicious? What specifically changed between their daytime and nighttime sessions? (Look at IP addresses AND files accessed.)

**Q3.** List every file the suspect downloaded during the suspicious session. Why would each of these files be considered sensitive or confidential?

**Q4.** One of the entries in the server log shows a POST request to `/admin/export.php`. What does a POST request mean, and why is this action more concerning than a GET request in this context?

### Section B — Email Header Analysis

**Q5.** What is the originating IP address of the email? How does this connect to the server log?

**Q6.** Why is the use of ProtonMail significant in this investigation? What does it suggest about the suspect's intent?

**Q7.** The email subject line is blank. Why might a suspect deliberately send an email with no subject? What technique might they be using?

**Q8.** Compare the email timestamp to the server log. What does the timeline suggest about the order of events on the night of April 18?

### Section C — File Metadata Analysis

**Q9.** The three large data files (`.zip`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`) all have the same "Created" date and time range. What does this tell you about how they got onto the USB drive?

**Q10.** The "Last Accessed" timestamp on every file is `2026-04-19 08:15:01`. Why are they all identical? What event caused this?

**Q11.** `note_to_self.txt` was created at `23:44:00` and the email was sent at `23:32:00`. Does this timeline make sense given what the note contains? Explain.

### Section D — Putting It All Together

**Q12.** Write a 1–2 paragraph **incident summary** describing what you believe happened on the night of April 18, 2026. Use specific evidence (timestamps, filenames, IP addresses) to support your conclusion. This is similar to what a real digital forensics analyst would write in an official report.

**Q13.** What laws or regulations might the suspect have violated? Name at least TWO (examples: CFAA — Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, HIPAA, FERPA, state data breach laws).

**Q14.** If you were the IT security team, what THREE security measures could have prevented or detected this breach earlier?
